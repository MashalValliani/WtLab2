	 <h3>WHAT'S THE STORY?<h3>
	    <p style="text-indent:10px; margin-top:-20px;font-size:15px;">THE NUN, which takes place before the events of the Annabelle and Conjuring movies, a young nun kills herself by jumping out the window of her Romanian abbey. It's 1952, and the Vatican calls upon Father Burke (Demian Bichir) -- who's experienced in exorcisms -- and young, idealistic novitiate Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who has yet to take her vows, to investigate. They get help from a local called "Frenchie" (Jonas Bloquet), who delivers supplies to the abbey. Father Burke and Sister Irene are asked to spend the night at the abbey, but strange things start happening almost immediately. Soon it becomes apparent that an evil that has lived in the abbey has been released. The visitors must find the key to sealing it up again before it's too late.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		 <h3>IS IT ANY GOOD?<h3>
	    <p style="text-indent:10px; margin-top:-20px;font-size:15px;">Sadly, this fifth chapter in the Conjuring franchise is, despite a temptingly promising locale/premise, nowhere near as scary, inspired, or coherent as its predecessors. The Nun boasts a strong cast -- led by Oscar nominee Bichir and Farmiga (the younger sister of Vera Farmiga, who played Lorraine Warren in the two Conjuring movies). Early images of dimly lit rooms in the Vatican and the first glimpses of the haunted abbey bring to mind atmospheric chillers like The Exorcist or The Orphanage. But viewers' hopes are quickly dashed by the quick onslaught of jump scares (punctuated by sudden loud noises on the soundtrack) or characters waking up from "surprise" nightmares.<br>
